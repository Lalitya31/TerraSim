Place your background image here

If you want to use a photographic background (recommended), copy your image into this folder with the filename `bg-photo.jpg`. The app will use `/bg-photo.jpg` as the page background, applying a warm translucent overlay for readability.

If `bg-photo.jpg` is not present, the app falls back to the built-in `bg-farm.svg` decorative image.
