# TerraSim
A simulation driven climate risk-engine for crop decisions.

Frontend: the UI now auto-connects to the backend on load (default endpoint `http://localhost:5000` or `REACT_APP_API_ENDPOINT`). The connection indicator in the header shows status and a small retry action; the manual API-config box was removed to streamline the UX.
